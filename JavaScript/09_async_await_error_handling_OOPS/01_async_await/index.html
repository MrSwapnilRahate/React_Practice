/*
    Some key concepts related to JS execution and rendering in the browser. Let me explain each of them in more detail:
        1. Call Stack: The call stack is a data structure that keeps track of the function calls in a jS program. It
            follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. When a function is called, it"s pushed onto the call stack, 
            and when it returns or completes, it's popped off the stack. This stack detremines the order in which sync 
            code is executed.
    
        2. MicroTask Queue: The microtask queue is a seprate queue that handles microtask, which have a higher priority
            than tasks. Promise and certain other asyn operations, like "process.nextTick" in Node.js or
            "MutationObserver" in the browser, schedule to run as microtask. Microtask are executed before the next rendering, 
            and they are processed entirely before tasks.
        
        This means that if there are microtasks in queue, they will be executed before any task in the task queue.

        3. Task Queue: The task queue, often refered to as the "task queue" or "callback queue", is a part of the event loop in JS.
            It's responsible for managing async code execution.
            when async events like I/O operations, timer (e.g. setTimeOut) or event Listeners (e.g. click event) have their callback functions ready to run,
                those callback are placed 7in the task queue.
        
        The event loop continiously checks if the call stack is empty. If it is, it takes the next task from the task queue and pushes 
            it onto the call stack for execution.
                
        4. UI Rendering: The browser's rendering engine is responsible for rendering web pages.
            The rendering process involves various steps, including layout, paint, and composite. The browser tries to render at a consistent
            frame rate, typically 60 frames per second (FPS) for smooth animation.
