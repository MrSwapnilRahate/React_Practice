Why promises are better than callback
    1. Promises can be ieither resolved or rejected once in the lifestyle. (So we can trust other code).
    2. Callback of promise go to a seprate queue known as a microtask queue it has higher priority than the normal callback queue.
    3. we can avoid pyramid of dom structure easily.
    4. code is cleaner and easy to read/maintain.

Promise is a logic so it is a part of a JS(language).
